# MarinersBigLeagueMinorImprovements
A data analysis and statistical study of the Seattle Mariners in their current rostered form, 2023. 
The project is based on mathematical and statistical principles for each hitter who had a minimum of 50 PA's and ended the season on the Mariner's 40-man roster. 
The primary data sources are open sources [will be linked in another file] and, with time, integration of open source video, predictive AI, and biometrics of swing mechanics and locations. 

The focus will be an offensive scouting report that is used, not bijectively, to analyze areas of improvement for individual hitters according to their tendencies, situations, and historical data reporting.
